   # it will find out template.yml file which having the resources
   # by default hello-world folder contains the src files
   # we can change the resources based upon the requirement that you have (ex: python 3.7 -> python 3.8)
  
  
3. SAM local start-api (fire up this command to start local restapi)

   # for the first time it will take (10-15 min) time to execute because of installing docker image based on opted stack
   # docker image called lambci/lambda (docker images) get pulled 
   # by default api mapped to 0.0.0.0:3000
   
  
  
4. SAM deploy -guided  

  # when developers done with development then can push into the cloud bu firing the above command
